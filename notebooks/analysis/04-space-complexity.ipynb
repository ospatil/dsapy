    "It can be defined as: Order of growth of memory space in terms of input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def sum(n):\n",
    "        return n * (n + 1)//2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is $\\Theta(1)$ since only 1 variable is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum2(n):\n",
    "    sum = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(1, n+1):\n",
    "        sum += i\n",
    "    return sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is still $\\Theta(1)$ since only 3 variables are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def arrSum(arr):\n",
    "    sum = 0\n",
    "    for i in arr:\n",
    "        sum += i\n",
    "    return sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is $\\Theta(n)$ since we need array of size $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Auxiliary Space**\n",
    "> Order of growth of extra space (any space other than needed for input and output) in terms of input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the earlier `arrSum` example, aux space is $\\Theta(1)$ and space complexity is $\\Theta(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For arrays and lists, the space complexity is anyways going to be $\\Theta(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, _auxiliary space_ is an important criteria in analysis.\n",

    "The function call stack for the invocation `recSum(5)` can be visualized as follows:\n",

    "The space complexity: $\\Theta(n)$.\n",

    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following fibonacci implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n",
