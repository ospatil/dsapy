    "Some solutions (Python):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```python\n",
    "    def sum1(n):\n",
    "      return n * (n + 1) / 2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   Total work done: $c_{1}$ and it is not dependent on $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ```python\n",
    "   def sum2(n):\n",
    "       sum = 0\n",
    "       for n in range(n + 1):\n",

    "### Best, Average and Worst Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's Consider some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```python\n",
    "   def nsum(arr, n):\n",
    "     sum = 0\n",
    "     for i in range(n):\n",
    "       sum += arr[i]\n",
    "     return sum\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   This function is _linear_.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ```python\n",
    "    def nsum(arr, n):\n",
    "      if n % 2 != 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "      sum = 0\n",
    "      for i in range(n):\n",
    "        sum += arr[n]\n",
    "      return sum\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "    \\\n",
    "   _Best Case_: When _n_ is odd, it's going to take _constant_ time. \\\n",
    "   _Average Case_: Often it's impractical to calculate unless you know all the inputs that will be provided to the algorithm all the time. \\\n",
    "   _Worst Case_: When _n_ is even it will be _linear_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst Case** is considered the most important case for algorithm analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Cases are not related to notations**. You can use the any notation for any case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asymptotic Notations\n",
    "\n",
    "_Big O_: Represents _exact_ or _upper_ bound i.e. order of growth. \\\n",
    "_Big Theta (ùõ≥)_: Represents _exact_ bound. \\\n",
    "_Big Omega (Œ©)_: Represents _exact_ or _lower_ bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big O** is the most common notation used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "> $f(n) = O(g(n))$ if and only if there are exact constants $c$and $n_0$ such that $f(n) \\leqslant cg(n)$ for all $n \\geqslant n_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, _we want to find a function $g(n)$ that is always going to be equal to or greater than $f(n)$ when multiplied by a constant for large values of $n$_.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Big O](images/big-o.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(n) = 2n + 3$can be written as $O(n)$ after ignoring co-efficient of highest-growing term and lower-order terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $f(n) \\leqslant O(g(n)$, equating it to above gives us $g(n) = n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's prove it mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(n) \\leqslant cg(n) \\space \\forall \\space n \\geqslant n_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{i.e.}\\space(2n + 3) \\leqslant cg(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{i.e.}\\space(2n + 3) \\leqslant cn \\space \\because g(n) = n$\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick way to find the value of c is _take leading constant of highest growing term and add 1_.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore c = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Substituting} \\space c \\space \\text{to find the value of } n_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$2n + 3 \\leqslant 3n$\n",
    "\n",
    "$3 \\leqslant n \\therefore n_0 = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "So for all values of $n \\space \\geqslant 3$, the equation $2n+3 \\leqslant 3n$ holds true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we try putting some values, say $n = 4$ in above equation, we can observe it holds true. Hence proved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some more examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\{\\frac{n}{4}, 2n + 3, \\frac{n}{100} + \\log n, 100, \\log n, ...\\} \\in O(n)$\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. $\\{n^2 + n, 2n^2, \\frac{n^2}{100}, ...\\} \\in O(n^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Big O is upper bound, all functions in 1 can be said to belong to 2, but it helps to use _tight bounds_.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Big O gives the **upper bound**. If we say an algorithm is linear, then the algorithm in question is $ \\leqslant O(n)$. So, it's going to perform linearly in worst case scenario or better. Therefore Big O is the upper bound of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> $f(n) = \\Omega(g(n))$ iff there are exact constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that $0 \\leqslant cg(n) \\leqslant f(n)$ for all $n \\geqslant n_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Big Omega is exact opposite of Big O.\n",
    "- Big Omega gives the **lower bound** of an algorithm i.e. the algorithm will perform at least or better than it.\n",
    "- Example - $f(n) = 2n + 3 = \\Omega(n)$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- $\\{\\frac{n}{4}, \\frac{n}{2}, 2n, 2n+3, n^2 ...\\} \\in \\Omega(n)$ i.e. all the functions having order of growth greater than or equal to linear.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If $f(n) = \\Omega(g(n)) \\space \\small{then} \\space g(n) = O(f(n))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big ùõ≥ Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "> $f(n) = \\Theta(g(n))$ iff there are exact constants $c_1, c_2, n_0$ such that $0 \\leqslant c_1g(n) \\leqslant f(n) \\leqslant c_2g(n) \\space \\small{for all} \\space n \\geqslant n_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Big Theta gives the **exact bound** on the order of growth of a function.\n",
