    "- heapsort\n",
    "- implementing priority queue\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Min heap** - highest priority item is assigned lowest value\n",
    "2. **Max heap** - highest priority item is assigned highest value\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary heap is a **complete binary tree** (stored as an array).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete binary tree is a binary tree whose all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has to be filled from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Left child of node at index i: `left(i) = 2i + 1`\n",
    "- Right child of node at index i: `right(i) = 2i + 2`  \n",
    "- Parent of node at index i: `parent(i) = floor((i - 1)/2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array representation advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Contiguous storage therefore random access\n",
    "2. Cache friendliness\n",
    "3. Since it's a complete binary tree, the height is minimum possible height (log n)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Min Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete binary tree\n",
    "- Every node has value smaller than its descendants\n",

    "- insert\n",
    "- extract min\n",
    "- decrease key\n",
    "- delete\n",
